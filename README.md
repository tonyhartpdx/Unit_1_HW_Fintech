## Overview and Origin

* Name of company Expensify

* When was the company incorporated? 2008

* Who are the founders of the company? David Barret, CEO and Founder

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

David Barrett was living in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood. As David walked past the same homeless folks on the street every day, he wanted to find an alternative way to help them without giving them cash directly. David imagined handing homeless people debit cards that would be linked to his personal account to ensure people were able to buy food, while still able to access public services that require sobriety. 

When David pitched the idea to banks for funding the banks rejected it because it was too complicated, weird, and risky. That’s when Expensify was born – an expense report platform to serve as a Trojan horse. David came up with a low-risk idea to get the banks’ approval so he could continue working on the card technology.

In 2008, David launched the card technology concept at TechCrunch50 and reframed it as an expense management system called “Expensify: The Corporate Card for the Masses! With no plans of actually building it. But much to David’s surprise, people loved the expense reporting concept.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Expensify is a piece of software that allows you to document and manage your company’s expenses. This handy piece of software allows you to do real-time reporting and tracking of you companies spending to help track where your money is really going. 

Above and beyond the convenience factor of not having to have boxes of receipts and financial paperwork, Expensify helps you forecast the future. It lets you determine which teams of people are spending money and where. 

This allows you to properly determine if you should go on your next business trip or hire a new employee because you know exactly how much each expense will cost the business.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Ease of use has been used to explain why companies choose Expensify over their competitors. In a specific example, according to a case study on La Trobe. La Trobe turned to Expensify instead of a competitor (Concur), knowing employees would embrace the easy-to-use mobile app. (use.expensify.com/case-study-latrobe)

Expensify possesses 13 registered patents in the computing and calculating category. They have also 10 registered trademarks. The unfair advantages they use come in the form of intellectual property.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Expensify operates in the travel and expense reporting domain. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

According to Oracle Netsuite, the top 4 expense management industry trends in 2020 are:
1.	Mobility: Employees want to use their mobile devices to create reports then input, track and submit their expenses. 
Vendors are responding to this by rolling out systems that allow for the submittal and approval of claims via smartphone—that includes snapping photos of receipts and uploading them into the system. Even better: OCR capabilities to “read” receipts and auto-fill fields. 

2.	Travel: As companies reimagine business travel in the post-pandemic world, the need for good expense tracking will continue. With an automated expense management solution in place, finance teams can institute new policies and monitor compliance to ensure that employees are not abusing the reimbursement system—and take quick corrective action if they are. Simply alerting supervisors in near real time so they can alert individual employees that they’re spending more than they should nip problems in the bud.

3.	Integration: By consolidating a range of travel and expense data and automatically sharing it with a company’s ERP and other systems, integrated expense management solutions drive most of the friction out of a typically cumbersome, expensive process.

Look for built-in integrations with your accounting system, the ability to link policies and those guardrails into any travel booking tools, the ability to granularly report on travel and expense spending and support for complying with relevant regulations.

4.	AI, Automation and Machine Learning in Expense Management:
Machine learning systems look at lots of data and learn from it. A company can feed a year’s worth of expense reports into an ML-enabled T&E system with the goal of teaching it to flag anomalies that might indicate fraud or human error. The more reports the system has to study, the better it will spot potential problems.

The difference between ML, which looks at good examples and bad ones and learns how to spot the bad, and AI is that artificial intelligence ups the ante by adding additional context.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Expensify has become a game changer in the world of travel and expense reporting. Their technology and innovation has allowed their customers to save notable amounts of time and shaved off costs of operating business. They continue to develop new technology in order to provide increasing value to their customers and they keep pushing the envelop in terms of industry standards, pushing their competitors to stay on their toes. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Customer retention is a core component in whether or not these companies are succeeding. Many of these companies are run on a subscription-based business model and these companies try there best to reduce churn. One metric widely used is MRR or Monthly Recurring Revenue paid by customer per month. 

In terms of customer retention, Expensify does fairly well compared to their competitors.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

I was unable to find any current, relevant data on how exactly Expensify is performing against its competitors. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

I don’t think that there is currently a feature within the Expensify technology that allows for reoccurring expenses to be submitted automatically on a recurring basis. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This would be a feature that would save lots of time for customers and it would add to the value received and could create more demand for their services. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Machine-learning algorithms could be used. Possibly also deep learning technology. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Machine-learning algorithms can be used to find patterns in data which is relevant for finding reoccurring expenses.
